# AJAX JavaScript Project - Fetching and Displaying API Data

This is a simple project aimed at helping you learn how to use XMLHttpRequest to make AJAX requests in JavaScript, set up event listeners for button clicks and DOMContentLoaded, parse and handle JSON responses from APIs, and display API data on a web page using innerHTML. Additionally, you'll also gain an understanding of how to structure a basic JavaScript file and function.
